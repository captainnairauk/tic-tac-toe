# Tic Tac Toe 

A simple browser-based **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project is part of **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** curriculum, specifically from the **JavaScript Course** section.  
The goal of this exercise was to practice **modular programming** and the **Module Pattern** in JavaScript.

- Dynamic messages displaying player turns, wins, and draws.

##  About The Odin Project
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) is a free and open-source coding curriculum designed to help people learn full-stack web development.  
This project falls under the **JavaScript module**, where the focus is on:
- Writing **clean, maintainable code**.
- Practicing the **Module Pattern** (using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions – IIFE).
- Separating concerns between **game logic** and **UI display**.

---

##  What I Practiced
- Implementing **factory functions** (for players).
- Using the **Module Pattern** to structure code into:
  - `Gameboard` (manages board state).
  - `GameController` (handles game flow).
  - `DisplayController` (updates UI).
- Checking **win and draw conditions** programmatically.
- DOM manipulation (updating messages, grid rendering).
- Basic CSS for layout and styling.

---

##  Future Improvements
- Add single-player mode with basic AI.
- Improve responsive design for mobile.
- Highlight winning combination on the grid.
